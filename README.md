# MINECRAFT 2
welcome to the github repo for minecraft 2!!!!!!!! we can think of a real name later

## How to work on it:
guide to setting up your environment

### Installing Monogame
First step is setting up actual Monogame. Follow the link below:

https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/

Mainly, [setting up dev env](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/1_setting_up_your_development_environment_windows.html), and [creating a new project](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/2_creating_a_new_project_vs.html). USE VISUAL STUDIO. The others are optional but are short so I'd say read them still since theyre very helpful. Follow the guide and get the basic blue screen window opening.

### Setting up Minecraft 2
Using github destkop (or actual git if you want) clone the repo on your computer. Open the .sln in visual studio. it SHOULD work first time (like just click the run button and it should work), but if there are any errors tell me i probably know how to fix them since i was just debugging my laptop
